// JavaScript Loops!

/*
A loop in javascript is used to execute a block of code with a specified number of elements.
There are many examples of loops but first we are going to look at the for loop.
In this method, we do it by the following

for (initialization; condition; increment;){
    // then here we pass the code and print it out in the console
}
*/

//  Let's assume we want to do aloop on plates using the for loop: we do this

for (let plates = 1; plates <= 10; plates++) {
    console.log(`Plate Number ${plates}, You have recieved a ðŸŽ‚ `)
}
