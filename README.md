**Welcome** to the first episode of my JavaScript introduction series! In this journey / "Road Map", am going to cover the basics of the JavaScript programming language, including how to link JavaScript to an HTML file, how to declare variables and assign values to them, and an overview of the different data types in JavaScript.

 <hr> 

 > First, I start by discussing how JavaScript can be added to an HTML document, and the difference between internal and external JavaScript. Next, we'll cover the basics of variable declaration and assignment, including the different variable types and how to name them.

I will also cover the different data types in JavaScript, such as numbers, strings, and booleans, and show you how to work with them in your code. Whether you're new to programming or just new to JavaScript, this road map is the perfect starting point to learn the fundamentals of the language.

> After covering all the days of this road map, you and me will have a strong understanding of the basics of JavaScript and be ready to move on to more advanced topics.

Thank you for joining me for the first episode of this JavaScript series, stay tuned for the code [Day 02] where we will be diving deeper into the language. Don't forget to follow me to never miss an episode.
